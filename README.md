# Global monthly average temperature data

Download and create a subset of global monthly average temperature data for
different countries from [Berkeley Earth](https://berkeleyearth.org). This can
be used as sample data for introduction to programming and data science
classes.

## Download the data

Get the latest version of the dataset as a zip file from:
https://github.com/compgeolab/temperature-data/releases/latest/download/temperature-data.zip

The zip file contains CSVs with the monthly average temperature in degrees
Celsius, one for each country. See the [README.md](data/processed/README.md)
